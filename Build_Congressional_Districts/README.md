Building Congressional Districts using Spatial Analytics

Occasionally, the boundaries of congressional districts are purposefully drawn in a way to give an unfair advantage to  political party within a given state.



This project leverages population data, GPS data, and spatial analytics to generate unbiased congressional districts and reduce the drive time among congressional districts.



This analysis was built using Alteryx and leverages the following datasets:

* TomTom\_US\_2021\_Q4
* Experian US 2021 (QW4 2021 Release)(v.8.6)
